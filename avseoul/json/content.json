In my opinion, this illusion is the most distinguishing experience with other kind of digital contents. That is because the medium that conveys audience experience is the light which can make us have shape, color, volume, texture for every object. Moreover, projection mappings are available to experience without the typical square screen. For example, when audiences saw a digital content on typical screen, they just assumed that is not real because of the medium which is typical square screen made them realize that is not real but just digital contents. However, the shape of projection screen is just the shape of target object and the form of contents is not the pixel but light itself. So audiences will feel that it is more like special experience in real life not just watching digital contents on screen."}
