Among many physical phenomena, some movements are unpredictable or inconsistent; particularly the motion of particles in liquids and gases that always move randomly at any place. The unpredictable movement of smoke, which is infinitesimally small and subtle motion generated by air flow, allured me more than any other physical phenomena of the earth and motivated me to illustrate it at a new aspect. In this film, the piece of fabric represents smoke, and the dancer represents air. I tried to visualize rising smoke gradually taking shape and transforming into a different shape. The variations in choreography, the video editing skills, and visual consonance between the dancer (air) and the piece of fabric (smoke) were used to portray the four steps: Mergence, Assimilation, and Climax, and Vanishing."},
