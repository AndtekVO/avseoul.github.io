In my opinion, this illusion is the most distinguishing experience with other kind of digital contents. That is because the medium that conveys audience experience is the light which can make us have shape, color, volume, texture for every object. Moreover, projection mappings are available to experience without the typical square screen. For example, when audiences saw a digital content on typical screen, they just assumed that is not real because of the medium which is typical square screen made them realize that is not real but just digital contents. However, the shape of projection screen is just the shape of target object and the form of contents is not the pixel but light itself. So audiences will feel that it is more like special experience in real life not just watching digital contents on screen."}

Among many physical phenomena, some movements are unpredictable or inconsistent; particularly the motion of particles in liquids and gases that always move randomly at any place. The unpredictable movement of smoke, which is infinitesimally small and subtle motion generated by air flow, allured me more than any other physical phenomena of the earth and motivated me to illustrate it at a new aspect. In this film, the piece of fabric represents smoke, and the dancer represents air. I tried to visualize rising smoke gradually taking shape and transforming into a different shape. The variations in choreography, the video editing skills, and visual consonance between the dancer (air) and the piece of fabric (smoke) were used to portray the four steps: Mergence, Assimilation, and Climax, and Vanishing."},
